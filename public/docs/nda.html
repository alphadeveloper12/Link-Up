  <p><strong>Purpose.</strong> The parties may exchange information to evaluate and/or perform
  <em>{{purpose}}</em> (the "Purpose").</p>

  <h2>1. Confidential Information</h2>
  <p>"Confidential Information" means non-public information disclosed by a party ("Discloser") to the other ("Recipient"),
  in any form, that is identified as confidential or should reasonably be considered confidential. Exclusions: information that
  (a) becomes public through no fault of Recipient; (b) was known without restriction; (c) is independently developed without use
  of Discloser's information; or (d) is rightfully received from a third party without duty of confidence.</p>

  <h2>2. Use & Care</h2>
  <p>Recipient will (i) use Confidential Information only for the Purpose; (ii) not disclose it except to its and its affiliates'
  employees, contractors, advisors, or prospective investors/lenders who need to know and are bound by duties no less protective
  than this Agreement ("Representatives"); and (iii) protect it using at least the same degree of care it uses for its own similar
  information, and no less than reasonable care. Recipient is responsible for its Representatives.</p>

  <h2>3. Compelled Disclosure</h2>
  <p>If legally compelled, Recipient may disclose after giving prompt notice (where lawful) and cooperating to seek protective treatment.
  Only what is legally required may be disclosed.</p>

  <h2>4. Ownership; No License</h2>
  <p>All Confidential Information remains Discloser's property. No license is granted except to use it for the Purpose.</p>

  <h2>5. Term; Survival</h2>
  <p>This Agreement begins on the Effective Date and continues for {{term_years}} years. Obligations for Confidential Information
  disclosed during the term survive for {{survival_years}} years; trade secrets are protected as long as they remain trade secrets.</p>

  <h2>6. Return/Destruction</h2>
  <p>Upon request or termination, Recipient will return or destroy Confidential Information and may retain one archival copy solely for
  legal/compliance purposes, which remains subject to this Agreement.</p>

  <h2>7. Remedies</h2>
  <p>Unauthorized use or disclosure may cause irreparable harm; Discloser may seek injunctive relief in addition to other remedies.</p>

  <h2>8. No Warranty</h2>
  <p>CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION IS PROVIDED "AS IS".</p>

  <h2>9. Governing Law; Venue</h2>
  <p>This Agreement is governed by {{governing_law}} law. The parties submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts in
  {{venue}} (or as otherwise agreed in writing).</p>
